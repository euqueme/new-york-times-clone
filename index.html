			<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
				with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
				equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have 
				been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to 
				begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused 
				space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to 
				swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
				<br><br>
				If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from 
				pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles 
				and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
				<br><br>
				“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
				<br><br>
				On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, 
				and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
				<br><br>
				Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of 
				astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
				space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched 
				violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought 
				smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
				<br><br>
				Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
				<br><br>
				If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy 
				pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
				<br><br>
				Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of 
				galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, 
				beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
			</p>
			<h2>‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>
			<p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>
				Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
				<br><br>
				He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
				<br><br>
				The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
				<br><br>
				Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

				<h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
				<p class="small-text">Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

				<p class="img1-text small-text position-relative"> <b>THE UNIVERSE </b>is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe 
					a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we 
					look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
